## Assignment Answers

### 1. Onboarding Events

#### Conversion by Stages:
- onboarding_start → profile_start: 83.1% (16.9% loss)
- profile_start → email_submit: 72.5% (12.6% loss)
- email_submit → paywall_show: 67.5% (7.0% loss)
- paywall_show → payment_done: 5.4% (92.0% loss)

#### Top-3 Promising Experiments:
1. **exp_2**: 9.1% conversion (5,731 users) - statistically significant 49.8% lift
2. **exp_6**: 6.8% conversion (4,586 users) - positive effect
3. **exp_9**: 6.5% conversion (4,173 users) - positive effect

### 2. Daily Tasks

#### Proposed Metrics for Evaluation:
- **Acceptance Rate** - percentage of accepted suggested tasks
- **Completion Rate** - percentage of completed tasks
- **Replacement Rate** - percentage of replacement requests
- **Retention Impact** - impact on user retention
- **Engagement Score** - engagement level

#### Improvements Based on Onboarding Analysis:
- Personalization by funnel types (female/male/main)
- Integration with pre-paywall process
- Application of successful elements from experiments

### 3. Feasibility Assessment

#### Evaluation Methodology:
1. **Behavior Analysis**: studying usage patterns
2. **Quantitative Research**: surveys, metrics analysis
3. **Prototyping**: MVP, A/B testing

#### Success Criteria:
- Acceptance Rate > 60%
- Completion Rate > 40%
- Retention Impact > +15%
- Engagement Score > +25%

## Detailed Funnel Types Analysis

### User Distribution:
- **Female**: 55,000 users (55%)
- **Male**: 35,000 users (35%)
- **Main**: 10,000 users (10%)

### Conversion by Funnel Types:
- **Main**: 6.8% (best result)
- **Female**: 5.2% (average result)
- **Male**: 4.8% (lowest result)

### Losses by Stages:
- **Main**: consistent losses across all stages
- **Female**: highest losses at profile_start → email_submit
- **Male**: critical losses at paywall_show → payment_done

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (1-2 weeks):
1. Analyze causes of 92% paywall losses
2. Study successful elements of exp_2
3. Plan A/B tests

### Medium-term (1-2 months):
1. Develop MVP for daily tasks
2. Funnel personalization
3. Pilot launch for 5% of users

### Long-term (3-6 months):
1. Complete funnel redesign
2. Gamified task system
3. AI personalization

## Expected Results

### Onboarding Optimization:
- Increase conversion from 5.4% to 8-10%
- Additional revenue: +50-85%

### Daily Tasks:
- Increase retention by 15-25%
- Increase app usage time by 20-30%

## Technical Details

### Running Analysis:
```bash
# Main onboarding analysis
python scripts/analyze_onboarding.py

# Experiment analysis
python scripts/analyze_experiments.py

# Funnel types analysis
python scripts/analyze_funnel_types.py

# Create visualizations
python scripts/visualize_funnel.py

# Enhanced analysis with confidence intervals
python scripts/enhanced_analysis.py

# User segmentation analysis
python scripts/segmentation_analysis.py
```

### Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

### Data Structure:
- **user_id**: unique user identifier
- **event_type**: event type (onboarding_start, profile_start, etc.)
- **event_time**: event timestamp
- **event_params**: JSON with additional parameters

## Analysis Improvements

### New Capabilities:
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI for all A/B tests
- **Data Quality Analysis**: duplicate detection, suspicious user identification
- **Temporal Analysis**: conversion trends by weeks
- **Statistical Power**: significance testing and effect size estimation
- **Segmentation**: analysis by platforms, devices, countries
- **Enhanced Metrics**: conversion at each stage, not just maximum reached

### Key Improvements:
- **exp_2**: statistically significant lift +49.8% (p < 0.001)
- **exp_6**: positive effect +15.5%, but not significant (p = 0.39)
- **exp_9**: positive effect +9.1%, but not significant (p = 0.56)
- **Data Quality**: 0% duplicates, clean data
- **Temporal Stability**: conversion stable across weeks

## Additional Insights

### By Funnel Types:
- **Female** (55% users): stable conversion, focus on planning
- **Male** (35% users): highest losses, need simple instructions
- **Main** (10% users): best conversion, universal approach

### Temporal Patterns:
- Data for 3 months (January-April 2024)
- Stable conversion patterns
- Opportunity for seasonal analysis

### Statistical Significance:
- exp_2 showed statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05)
- exp_6 and exp_9 showed positive effects but didn't reach statistical significance
- Other experiments showed no significant improvements
